# Miles Ramsey




Intro

I’m a young professional living in downtown Salt Lake City. Currently I work as a Senior Developer at Salesforce Commerce Cloud working on point of sale software. In my free time I enjoy playing dodgeball and kickball, playing retro video games, and most recently collecting vinyl. I always like to have a book to read, and currently it’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. I’m always looking for something new to learn, and am currently pursuing getting a Master’s Degree.
